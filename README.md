## Project Setup

1. Install the dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

2. Start the development server:

```bash
npm start
```

This will start the development server and open the application in your default browser.

## Project Structure

- `index.js`: This is the entry point of the application. It loads a remote microfrontend module and renders it in the `App` component.
- `ErrorMessage.js`: This component is rendered when there's an error loading the remote module.

## Loading Remote Modules

The `loadRemoteModule` function is used to load a remote module at runtime. It takes an object with `url`, `scope`, and `module` properties:

- `url`: The URL of the remote entry file.
- `scope`: The global variable defined in the remote entry file that Webpack uses to load the remote module.
- `module`: The path to the module within the remote project.

The `loadRemoteModule` function returns a promise that resolves with the loaded module when it's available. If there's an error loading the module, the promise is rejected.

## Error Handling

If there's an error loading the remote module, the `ErrorMessage` component is rendered. This component displays a simple error message.
