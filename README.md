## Project Setup

1. Install the dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

2. Start the development server:

```bash
npm start
```

This will start the development server and open the application in your default browser.

## Project Structure

- `index.js`: This is the entry point of the application. It loads a remote microfrontend module and renders it in the `App` component.
- `ErrorMessage.js`: This component is rendered when there's an error loading the remote module.

## Loading Remote Modules

The `loadRemoteModule` function is used to load a remote module at runtime. It takes an object with `url`, `scope`, and `module` properties:

- `url`: The URL of the remote entry file.
- `scope`: The global variable defined in the remote entry file that Webpack uses to load the remote module.
- `module`: The path to the module within the remote project.

The `loadRemoteModule` function returns a promise that resolves with the loaded module when it's available. If there's an error loading the module, the promise is rejected.

## Error Handling

If there's an error loading the remote module, the `ErrorMessage` component is rendered. This component displays a simple error message.

This `README.md` provides a brief overview of the project, instructions on how to set up and run the project, and explanations of the main parts of the project. You can expand it with more details as needed.
